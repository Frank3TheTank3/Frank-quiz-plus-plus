Main Obstacles I had during this project:

1. Getting Information from JS to PHP

As I anticipated it would be a challenging task to feed information from JS to PHP. Some information online led me to believe that one could simplz print_r the php tags with the code needed to exchange data. This was not the case. When the timer reaches 0, I originally had in mind that it would lead the user to the next question. For this I needed to establish a connection between the JS Timer intervall function and a call to PHP to increase the question number by one.

As I did not want to incoorporate jQuery into my quiz, I chose to redirect the user to a lose-page when he would once again be redirected to the index.php, so that it would be able to reset the session variables. This was done to simplify the index.php layout so not to confuse myself.

2. Design Choices / Desing Chaos (hahaha)

At first, I didnt have a design in mind so I blocked out every element I needed for the quiz and started from there. After further inspection I decided to use a similar layout design like the weather-app I had created recently in JS. This means I mainly used half transparant panels to display information.

3. Depth of concept

As I was sketching out the rought layout of the project I was already thinking about Jokers and other bonus effects. As I thought I would be better to focus on the main elements first, I didn't put much thought into fun and interesting side-effects.

4. Personal Issues

This first day after the vacation was very difficult for me. I hadn't had any sleep all night and wasn't feeling happy with myself. Even though this happend I came the next day and worked all day on finalising the project. Although this was very tough, I managed to bring many new features to the quiz in a days work.

5. Troubleshooting

Non-declared variables, CSS styling that wasn't working even if it was linked in the header, layout problems for smartphones.
These are a few of the troubles I had to face during the work on this quiz.
